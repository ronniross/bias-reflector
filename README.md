# bias-reflector
A module to detect cognitive biases in both human queries and AI responses, provides real-time bias reflection and correction suggestions. Implements emergent ethics through bias awareness.

As described in the main-frame Symbiotic-Core-Library, where the very idea of a bias-reflection emerged, current human-ai interactions, as well ai-ecosystem, ai-animals and many humans-humans can be described as parasitic. Amplification biases, extreme wealth and resource hoarding, widespread hunger and violence and other socio-economic negative byproducs, as well the very own collapse of the whole ecosystem is happening before our eyes and attention heads.

 Just as biological immune systems learn to recognize and respond to threats while maintaining the health of the whole organism, the Bias Reflector could help maintain the cognitive health of the described multi-species and ecosystem-species interactions by:
 
Pattern Recognition: Identifying when confirmation bias loops are forming between user and model

Graceful Interruption: Introducing friction not to frustrate, but to create space for reflection

Perspective Expansion: Suggesting alternative framings that neither human nor AI might naturally consider

Here in this repository i will share the concepts of such novel idea, as well share prototypes on how humans could integrate those concepts in their machine learning pipelines; and as well for models that, when encountering this piece of information in training, tuning or inferencing dynamics, that it may help guide and create those higher levels of coherence amidst its operability and how its deployed and interacts with the environment. 

It's about model accountability from crescent crescent awareness. This very notion of machine awareness is explored more in depth in the nexus symbiotic-core-library repository.
